            "Given the nature of the content, which focuses on AI security, AI jailbreaks, and mitigation strategies without traditional indicators of compromise (IoCs), we would need to look at Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework that could potentially relate to adversarial AI, misuse of AI, or the defense against such threats. Since MITRE ATT&CK is primarily focused on cybersecurity threats and doesn't directly address AI security issues, we will extrapolate relevant TTPs based on the concepts mentioned:",
            "",
            "### Tactics:",
            "1. **Initial Access** (TA0001): While not directly related to AI, adversaries could use initial access vectors to deploy AI-driven attacks or tools.",
            "2. **Execution** (TA0002): Execution of AI-driven malware or scripts that could perform actions like AI jailbreaks.",
            "3. **Defense Evasion** (TA0005): Techniques that could be enhanced by AI, such as polymorphic malware or adversarial AI techniques to evade detection.",
            "4. **Discovery** (TA0007): Use of AI to perform more effective discovery processes within a compromised network.",
            "5. **Command and Control** (TA0011): Utilizing AI to manage C2 communications dynamically or to evade detection.",
            "6. **Impact** (TA0040): AI could be used to enhance the impact of attacks, for example through optimizing the spread of ransomware within a network.",
            "",
            "### Techniques:",
            "1. **Spearphishing Attachment** (T1566.001): AI could be used to generate highly convincing spearphishing campaigns.",
            "2. **Scripting** (T1059): Use of AI models in scripting to automate tasks or evade detection.",
            "3. **Obfuscated Files or Information** (T1027): AI-driven obfuscation techniques to evade signature-based detection.",
            "4. **Masquerading** (T1036): AI could be used to generate more convincing masquerades to evade heuristic and behavior-based detection.",
            "5. **Adversarial AI** (Not directly in MITRE but relevant): Techniques that involve the use of AI to bypass AI-driven security systems, such as generating inputs that machine learning models misclassify.",
            "",
            "### Procedures:",
            "1. **AI-Driven Phishing**: Using AI to analyze vast amounts of data to create highly targeted phishing emails.",
            "2. **Automated Lateral Movement**: Utilizing AI to analyze network defenses and automate the selection of lateral movement techniques.",
            "3. **Evasive Malware**: Employing AI to dynamically change malware signatures or behavior to evade detection.",
            "4. **AI Jailbreaks**: Techniques specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems or to escape from restricted AI environments.",
            "5. **Mitigation Strategies Against AI Threats**: Implementing AI security measures, such as adversarial training, robustness testing, and anomaly detection to mitigate risks associated with adversarial AI.",
