                "- **Resource Development (T1583):** The IoCs include domain names and URLs that could be used for hosting malicious content or command and control (C2) infrastructure, indicating preparation for attacks.",
                "- **Initial Access (T1078):** The use of legitimate but potentially compromised or masquerading domain names (e.g., \"aka.ms\", \"linkedin.com\") suggests tactics for gaining initial access through phishing or trusted relationship abuse.",
                "- **Command and Control (T1071):** The IP addresses listed in the IoCs may serve as C2 servers for maintaining communication with compromised hosts.",
                "- **Execution (T1204):** The presence of file hashes indicates the execution of specific malware or scripts on targeted systems."
            ],
            "Techniques": [
                "- **Domain Generation Algorithms (T1568.002):** The use of various domain names might suggest the use of algorithms to dynamically generate domain names for C2, making detection harder.",
                "- **Spearphishing Link (T1566.002):** The presence of URLs associated with legitimate services (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) could indicate spearphishing campaigns that leverage these platforms for initial access.",
                "- **Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048):** The use of specific IP addresses and domains could be related to data exfiltration attempts over protocols not typically monitored closely.",
                "- **User Execution (T1204.002):** The file hashes represent malware or tools that require user execution to initiate an attack, indicating social engineering techniques to convince users to run these files."
            ],
            "Procedures": [
                "- **C2 Infrastructure Setup:** Utilizing the listed IP addresses and domain names to establish a robust command and control infrastructure that is difficult for defenders to take down or block.",
                "- **Phishing Campaign:** Crafting emails or social media messages that include the listed URLs, enticing targets to click through to sites that either directly compromise their system or harvest credentials.",
                "- **Malware Distribution:** Distributing malware through files associated with the provided hashes, possibly via email attachments or downloads from the listed domains, to execute on the victim's machine for initial compromise or further exploitation.",
                "- **Social Engineering:** Leveraging the reputation of legitimate services (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) mentioned in the URLs for operations designed to trick users into performing actions against their interests, such as divulging credentials or executing malicious files."
